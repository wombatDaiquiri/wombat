wombat is my content creation engine that I'm publishing open-source as I go, so you can learn from my mistakes

## what's next

currently I have two containers deployed in a kubernetes cluster;
- an nginx serving a static website
- a cloudflared tunnel that forwards traffic from the host to the first container

you can see the result on daiquiri.fyi

I will write some detailed tutorials eventually.
